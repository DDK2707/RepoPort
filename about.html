<h1 style="color: white;">About Dale</h1>
<p style="font-size: 130%; color: white ";> I write about whatever comes to mind at any point. <br>
It's paramount to have an outlet in order to express your feelings at any given moment <br>
My outlet is writing. I've been writing creatively for seven years, academically for three. I've even started dabbling in songwriting <br>
It's a means to both escape reality for a bit, and a way to meaningfully express the emotions that I have before they bubble over <br>
But writing isn't the only thing I love doing <br> 
With the songwriting, I want to hone my voice to be able to perform in my choice of genres: metal, rock, and RnB <br>
